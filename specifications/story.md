#### A different perspective


It's time to recruit new mentors and become a special member of the Codecool Family.

You are able to not even just observe a newly created CodecoolClass - full of extra-motivated mentors and students -, how there activities at school influence the individuals' lives but also manipulate them.

After the initialization part, through a menu section you can choose between different events, like playing a foosball tournament, drinking a cup of coffee, having lunch etc. and experience the consequences. This way the participants' skills can be increased or decreased (knowledge, energy, charisma). But! Unfortunately, your time is limited, so do not waste your actions!

A mentor/student's life is up to you!
